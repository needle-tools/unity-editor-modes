# Unity Modes üñ•

*Easily switch between or create new Unity editor modes!  
Use the same system that Unity's builtin Safe Mode does or the Standalone Profiler.*

## Usage üí°

Open ``Window/Needle/Unity Modes Window`` to easily switch between currently known modes (or shortcut ``Ctrl+F12``)  

Create new modes by creating a ``.mode`` file with your configuration (see builtin or [modes in this package](https://github.com/needle-tools/unity-editor-modes/tree/main/package/Editor/Modes) as reference)  

Startup Unity with a mode by passing the ``-mode`` command line argument with a name (must be the ``label`` field of the mode. e.g. ``-mode "Needle Console And Scene View"``). Buitin modes can be found in ``Editor\Data\Resources\default.mode``
